I am a sixth-year [Math](https://math.illinois.edu/) Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I am advised by [Richard S. Laugesen](https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/laugesen). Before joining UIUC, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at Nanjing University.

My research interests are in analysis and differential equations, where I also incorporate numerical methods as part of my approach. 

In addition to my primary research, I have worked on [multi-task learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6EqUpqMnwl) and maintain a broad interest in machine learning. I have also supervised multiple research projects on computational optimization at the [Illinois Mathematics Lab](https://iml.math.illinois.edu/).
