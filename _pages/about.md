I am a sixth-year Math Ph.D. student at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu), where I am advised by [Richard S. Laugesen](https://math.illinois.edu/directory/profile/laugesen). Prior to this, I earned my B.S. in Mathematics from the Kuang Yaming Honors School at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder. -->

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
